# Edwina-Dialogue-Tweaks
This mod adjusts four of CHARNAME's dialogue options with Edwina to make them a bit more respectful.

## FAQ

### Q: Why create this mod for just four lines of dialogue?

A: To give CHARNAME the option to respond to Edwina's transformation in a respectful way - rather than relying solely on the original humor. If you enjoy the default dialogue, that's totally fine, everyone has their own preferences. :)

### Q: Will there be any future updates?

A: I may extend some dialogue tweaks to the NPC banters with Edwina. Though each of them bring fun insights into the characters involved. The current scope is to subtly tweak the player responses rather than altering the NPC ones.
